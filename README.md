# Rizqi's gf's HTML assigment.

Let's all collaborate and be ove ambitious and finish off rizqi's homework together!

# Assignment
Using the methods and techniques explained in the module, create a 4 page web site that demonstrates your ability to incorporate images, external links, site navigation, and an email link into a web site about your 3 top interests: Stuff I Like. 
As an example, you could choose food, movies, and music. You will then devote each page to photos, text, and a few external links about each subject. The food page, for example, could have a photo of a hot dog followed by a few sentences on why you like hot dogs. This could then be followed up by some external links about hot dogs. Repeat the same process for the other 2 subjects. When you have all 3 pages coded and filled with plenty of information, link them all together with a homepage and navigation.

Your site should consist of 4 pages total, one page for each subject and one index page. They should all be placed in a folder named "yourname_stuffilike".
